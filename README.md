# wopeh
My first website for a client.  I am doing this site for a non-profit whose goal is to place horses, who were rescued from being put to death, 
into homes where the owner can keep them and care for them for the rest of their lives.  The business operates out of Deartrail, Colorado.  At first the site
won't be a ton more than some pages featuring particular horses for adoption, a landing page, and some information about whom to call if you are wanting to
make a donation or adopt a horse.  Additional functionality will be added as we go.

# What does wopeh mean?
It stands for "Way of Peace Equine Haven".  The services I would like the website to offer include adpotions from the onsite
horse population and a way to take donations.  Other features I would like to have is a newsletter signup, user stories section, 
and perhaps even a merchindise page. I want it to be a good solid website for a non-profit.
