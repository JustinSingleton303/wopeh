  "description": "My first website for a client.  I am doing this site for a non-profit whose goal is to place horses, who were rescued from being put to death,  into homes where the owner can keep them and care for them for the rest of their lives.  The business operates out of Deartrail, Colorado.  At first the site won't be a ton more than some pages featuring particular horses for adoption, a landing page, and some information about whom to call if you are wanting to make a donation or adopt a horse.  Additional functionality will be added as we go.",
